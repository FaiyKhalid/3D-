![women-stroke](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86845134/146293946-160fff8f-f2be-4baa-a1d5-48d21ca25bbc.png)


## Brief 
Data from patients with stable coronary artery disease and hypertension have shown that high 
resting heart rates are associated with an increased risk of stroke. Similarly, a study from the general 
Chinese population has suggested that high resting heart rates are associated with an increased stroke risk

## Attribute Information

1) id: unique identifier
2) gender: "Male", "Female" or "Other"
3) age: age of the patient
4) hypertension: 0 if the patient doesn't have hypertension, 1 if the patient has hypertension
5) heart_disease: 0 if the patient doesn't have any heart diseases, 1 if the patient has a heart disease
6) ever_married: "No" or "Yes"
7) work_type: "children", "Govt_jov", "Never_worked", "Private" or "Self-employed"
8) Residence_type: "Rural" or "Urban"
9) avg_glucose_level: average glucose level in blood
10) bmi: body mass index
11) smoking_status: "formerly smoked", "never smoked", "smokes" or "Unknown"*
12) stroke: 1 if the patient had a stroke or 0 if not
*Note: "Unknown" in smoking_status means that the information is unavailable for this patient

# Project Target

Knowing how upnormality in heartrate is related to getting a stroke

# Tools

• Pandas: a library offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.

• Numpy: a library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.

• Matplotlib: a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.

• Seaborn: a data visualization library built on top of matplotlib and closely integrated with pandas data structures in Python.

# What have been done in this project 

- Generating the model using the dataset.
- Downloading the required python packages.
- Importing the dataset in Pandas frame. 
- Specifying the target column (S).
- Cleaning the dataset.
- Finding descriptive statistic using special commands.
- Using Pandas profiling and matplotlib packages to generate graph and
- observe relationships with the target column in EDA section.
